Documentation
=============

**Archiefvernietigingscomponent (Archive destruction component) for 
"Zaakgericht werken" (case-oriented working), part of the** `Common Ground`_ 
**landscape.**

Record management is the practice of destroying data-records that have met their
end-of-life time. "Zaakgericht werken" prescribes the archiving terms for cases 
that have been brought to an end.

The Archiefvernietigingscomponent (AVC) provides functionality for record 
managers to schedule destruction of cases according to the archiving parameters.
It implements a multi-step, multi-role accordance process.

Attention is paid to the user experience of the staff using the app, with 
notifications to inform you of pending work-load, full audit logging and 
traceability of user and system actions.

The AVC supports all backends implementing the 1.0.x 
`API's voor Zaakgericht Werken`_, like `Open Zaak`_. It is designed according
to `Common Ground`_ principles as a re-usable application.
