What is the RMA?
----------------

Record management is the practice of destroying data-records that have met their
end-of-life time. "Zaakgericht werken" prescribes the archiving terms for cases that
have been brought to an end.

The RMA provides functionality for record managers to schedule destruction of cases
according to the archiving parameters. It implements a multi-step, multi-role accordance
process.

Attention is paid to the user experience of the staff using the app, with notifications
to inform you of pending work-load, full audit logging and traceability of user and
system actions.

The RMA supports all backends implementing the 1.0.x `API's voor Zaakgericht Werken`_.
